## Data Structure Basics

###**Array**
####Definition:
- Stores data elements based on an sequential, most commonly 0 based, index.
- Based on tuples from set theory.
- They are one of the oldest, most commonly used data structures.

####What you need to know:
- Optimal for indexing; bad at searching, inserting, and deleting (except at the end).
- **Linear arrays**, or one dimensional arrays, are the most basic.
  - Are static in size, meaning that they are declared with a fixed size.
- **Dynamic arrays** are like one dimensional arrays, but have reserved space for additional elements.
  - If a dynamic array is full, it copies it's contents to a larger array.
- **Two dimensional arrays** have x and y indices like a grid or nested arrays.

####Big O efficiency:
- Indexing:         Linear array: O(1),      Dynamic array: O(1)
- Search:           Linear array: O(n),      Dynamic array: O(n)
- Optimized Search: Linear array: O(log n),  Dynamic array: O(log n)
- Insertion:        Linear array: n/a        Dynamic array: O(n)

###**Linked List**
####Definition: 
- Stores data with **nodes** that point to other nodes.
  - Nodes, at its most basic it has one datum and one reference (another node).
  - A linked list _chains_ nodes together by pointing one node's reference towards another node.

####What you need to know:
- Designed to optimize insertion and deletion, slow at indexing and searching.
- **Doubly linked list** has nodes that reference the previous node.
- **Circularly linked list** is simple linked list whose **tail**, the last node, references the **head**, the first node.
- **Stack**, commonly implemented with linked lists but can be made from arrays too.
  - Stacks are **last in, first out** (LIFO) data structures.
  - Made with a linked list by having the head be the only place for insertion and removal.
- **Queues**, too can be implemented with a linked list or an array.
  - Queues are a **first in, first out** (FIFO) data structure.
  - Made with a doubly linked list that only removes from head and adds to tail.

####Big O efficiency:
- Indexing:         Linked Lists: O(n)
- Search:           Linked Lists: O(n)
- Optimized Search: Linked Lists: O(n)
- Insertion:        Linked Lists: O(1)

###**Hash Table or Hash Map**
####Definition: 
- Stores data with key value pairs.
- **Hash functions** accept a key and return an output unique only to that specific key.
  - This is known as **hashing**, which is the concept that an input and an output have a one-to-one correspondence to map information.
  - Hash functions return a unique address in memory for that data.

####What you need to know:
- Designed to optimize searching, insertion, and deletion.
- **Hash collisions** are when a hash function returns the same output for two distinct inputs.
  - All hash functions have this problem.
  - This is often accommodated for by having the hash tables be very large.
- Hashes are important for associative arrays and database indexing.

####Big O efficiency:
- Indexing:         Hash Tables: O(1)
- Search:           Hash Tables: O(1)
- Insertion:        Hash Tables: O(1)

###**Binary Tree**
####Definition: 
- Is a tree like data structure where every node has at most two children.
  - There is one left and right child node.

####What you need to know:
- Designed to optimize searching and sorting.
- A **degenerate tree** is an unbalanced tree, which if entirely one-sided is a essentially a linked list.
- They are comparably simple to implement than other data structures.
- Used to make **binary search trees**.
  - A binary tree that uses comparable keys to assign which direction a child is.
  - Left child has a key smaller than it's parent node.
  - Right child has a key greater than it's parent node.
  - There can be no duplicate node.
  - Because of the above it is more likely to be used as a data structure than a binary tree.

####Big O efficiency:
- Indexing:  Binary Search Tree: O(log n)
- Search:    Binary Search Tree: O(log n)
- Insertion: Binary Search Tree: O(log n)

####**Graph**
TBD

Candidates should be able to describe, for any of the data structures above:

what you use them for (real-life examples)
why you prefer them for those examples
the operations they typically provide (e.g. insert, delete, find)
the big-O performance of those operations (e.g. logarithmic, exponential)
how you traverse them to visit all their elements, and what order they're visited in
at least one typical implementation for the data structure

Candidates should know the difference between an abstract data type such as a Stack, Map, List or Set, and a concrete data structure such as a singly-linked list or a hash table. For a given abstract data type (e.g. a Queue), they should be able to suggest at least two possible concrete implementations, and explain the performance trade-offs between the two implementations.

Example weeder questions:

1) What are some really common data structures, e.g. in java.util?

2) When would you use a linked list vs. a vector?

3) Can you implement a Map with a tree? What about with a list?

4) How do you print out the nodes of a tree in level-order (i.e. first level, then 2nd level, then 3rd level, etc.)

5) What's the worst-case insertion performance of a hashtable? Of a binary tree?

6) What are some options for implementing a priority queue?

And so on. Just a few quick questions should cover this area, provided you don't focus exclusively on linear ordered sequences (lists, arrays, vectors and the like).

Algorithm Complexity: you need to know Big-O. It's a must. If you struggle with basic big-O complexity analysis, then you are almost guaranteed not to get hired. It's, like, one chapter in the beginning of one theory of computation book, so just go read it. You can do it.

Sorting: know how to sort. Don't do bubble-sort. You should know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quicksort and merge sort). Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it.

For God's sake, don't try sorting a linked list during the interview.

Hashtables: hashtables are arguably the single most important data structure known to mankind. You absolutely have to know how they work. Again, it's like one chapter in one data structures book, so just go read about them. You should be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one interview.

Trees: you should know about trees. I'm tellin' ya: this is basic stuff, and it's embarrassing to bring it up, but some of you out there don't know basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. You should be familiar with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees at the very very least. Trees are probably the best source of practice problems for your long-term warmup exercises.

You should be familiar with at least one flavor of balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree. You should actually know how it's implemented.

You should know about tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.

You might not use trees much day-to-day, but if so, it's because you're avoiding tree problems. You won't need to do that anymore once you know how they work. Study up!

Graphs

Graphs are, like, really really important. More than you think. Even if you already think they're important, it's probably more than you think.

There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list), and you should familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros and cons.

You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search. You should know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code.

You should try to study up on fancier algorithms, such as Dijkstra and A*, if you get a chance. They're really great for just about anything, from game programming to distributed computing to you name it. You should know them.

Whenever someone gives you a problem, think graphs. They are the most fundamental and flexible way of representing any kind of a relationship, so it's about a 50-50 shot that any interesting design problem has a graph involved in it. Make absolutely sure you can't think of a way to solve it using graphs before moving on to other solution types. This tip is important!

Other data structures

You should study up on as many other data structures and algorithms as you can fit in that big noggin of yours. You should especially know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise.

You should find out what NP-complete means.

Basically, hit that data structures book hard, and try to retain as much of it as you can, and you can't go wrong.

Math

Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent at Google than at other places I've been, and I consider it a Good Thing, even though I'm not particularly good at discrete math. We're surrounded by counting problems, probability problems, and other Discrete Math 101 situations, and those innumerate among us blithely hack around them without knowing what we're doing.

Don't get mad if the interviewer asks math questions. Do your best. Your best will be a heck of a lot better if you spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of combinatorics and probability. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk – the more the better.

I know, I know, you're short on time. But this tip can really help make the difference between a "we're not sure" and a "let's hire her". And it's actually not all that bad – discrete math doesn't use much of the high-school math you studied and forgot. It starts back with elementary-school math and builds up from there, so you can probably pick up what you need for interviews in a couple of days of intense study.

Sadly, I don't have a good recommendation for a Discrete Math book, so if you do, please mention it in the comments. Thanks.

Operating Systems

This is just a plug, from me, for you to know about processes, threads and concurrency issues. A lot of interviewers ask about that stuff, and it's pretty fundamental, so you should know it. Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work. Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread needs, and how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, and you'll be a dinosaur in a real hurry if you don't understand the fundamentals of "modern" (which is to say, "kinda broken") concurrency constructs.

The best, most practical book I've ever personally read on the subject is Doug Lea's Concurrent Programming in Java. It got me the most bang per page. There are obviously lots of other books on concurrency. I'd avoid the academic ones and focus on the practical stuff, since it's most likely to get asked in interviews.
