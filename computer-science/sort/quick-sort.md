## Sorting Basics
###**Merge Sort**
####Definition:
- A comparison based sorting algorithm
  - Divides entire dataset into groups of at most two.
  - Compares each number one at a time, moving the smallest number to left of the pair.
  - Once all pairs sorted it then compares left most elements of the two leftmost pairs creating a sorted group of four with the smallest numbers on the left and the largest ones on the right.
  - This process is repeated until there is only one set.

####What you need to know:
- This is one of the most basic sorting algorithms.
- Know that it divides all the data into as small possible sets then compares them.

####Big O efficiency:
- Best Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n)
- Average Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n log n)
- Worst Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n log n)

###**Quicksort**
####Definition:
- A comparison based sorting algorithm
  - Divides entire dataset in half by selecting the average element and putting all smaller elements to the left of the average.
  - It repeats this process on the left side until it is comparing only two elements at which point the left side is sorted.
  - When the left side is finished sorting it performs the same operation on the right side.
- Computer architecture favors the quicksort process.

####What you need to know:
- While it has the same Big O as (or worse in some cases) many other sorting algorithms it is often faster in practice than many other sorting algorithms, such as merge sort.
- Know that it halves the data set by the average continuously until all the information is sorted.

####Big O efficiency:
- Best Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n)
- Average Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n log n)
- Worst Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n^2)

###**Bubble Sort**
####Definition:
- A comparison based sorting algorithm
  - It iterates left to right comparing every couplet, moving the smaller element to the left.
  - It repeats this process until it no longer moves and element to the left.

####What you need to know:
- While it is very simple to implement, it is the least efficient of these three sorting methods.
- Know that it moves one space to the right comparing two elements at a time and moving the smaller on to left.

####Big O efficiency:
- Best Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n)
- Average Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n^2)
- Worst Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n^2)

####Merge Sort Vs. Quicksort
- Quicksort is likely faster in practice.
- Merge Sort divides the set into the smallest possible groups immediately then reconstructs the incrementally as it sorts the groupings.
- Quicksort continually divides the set by the average, until the set is recursively sorted.
